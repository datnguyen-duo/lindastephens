    <h3>About</h3>

    <p>Marketing gets busy and, in the jumble of all the busy, your firm may have gotten lost.
        Bringing clarity to your brand shows a path forward, focusing the lens on what makes your firm special to the clients you desire most.
        I believe that every company has singular characteristics, golden nuggets that attract these ideal clients.
        Drawing from years of experience as a marketing leader in architecture, the visual arts, design and technology, I’ll help your firm reveal these precious gems and create a fresh approach to brand strategy, messaging and marketing that spotlights your strengths, builds your reputation and attracts right-aligned clients.
        This is handcrafted marketing. </p>
